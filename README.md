## Introduction
**Pokémon CTRPluginFramework**

This is a Plugin for Pokémon Omega Ruby, Alpha Sapphire and Pokémon X and Y support is on it's way!
> Updates will follow any time

## Installation
Make sure you have a Custom Firmware installed on your Nintendo 3DS, if you don't you can't use this Plugin. This [Guide](https://3ds.hacks.guide/) will help you through the CFW installation if you don't have it installed yet.

Plugin Installation: Download the zip file from the Important Links or from the project and extract it on your PC. Insert your 3ds SD Card into your Computer and copy the whole `luma` folder on the root of it. Enable `Plugin Loader` in the Rosalina Menu and enter the Game. The Plugin should run now if the screen lights up in blue.

* This applies once the XY support is added
> Small change: Additionally to the luma folder, you will need to copy the `boot.firm` file on the root of your SD Card to run the Plugin properly!
