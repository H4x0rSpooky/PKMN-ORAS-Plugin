# Installation
Make sure you have a Custom Firmware installed on your Nintendo 3DS, if you don't you can't use this Plugin. [Guide](https://3ds.hacks.guide/) will help you through the CFW installation if you don't have it installed yet.

Plugin Installation: Download the zip file from [Important Links](#important links) or from the project and extract it on your PC. Insert your 3ds SD Card into your Computer and copy the whole `luma` folder on the root of it. Enable `Plugin Loader` in the Rosalina Menu and enter the Game. The Plugin should run now if the screen lights up in blue.
